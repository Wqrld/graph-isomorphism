# Graph isomorphism
Some code snippets for solving the graph isomorphism problem. These are not intended to be the fastest possible (for that, see babai's algorithm) but more for acquiring a taste for the problem.

## Running the tests
The individual files can be ran, but you can also just run all the tests with `python3 -m unittest`
